			<p class="parag1">The following is the original piece i wrote for CNN last year entrepreneurs, also known as "digital nomads." Since the whole "Work Online, Travel the World and Live the Dream" angle had been done to death in a million places, I decided to go the other direction and show the dark side of being a digital nomad - the challenges one faces, the emotional pitfalls, the social sacrifices.</p>
			<p>Predictably, CNN hated it. The editors hacked it to pieces and asked me to rewrite sections to make it less gloomy. But I was always fond of the original, so I'm posting it here unabridged.</p>
